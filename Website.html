              Hello! My name is Katherine Fritts, and I will discuss one of my greatest passions, horses. 
              Not just horses in general but a particular breed of horse, the Appaloosa. The Appaloosa, more 
              importantly, the Foundation Bred Appaloosa have captivated my heart, and I want my goals of owning, 
              showing, and breeding them to be part of my life. As a past veterinary technician, I knew I needed 
              to change my career path due to mental health and income. I went back to school and started my degree 
              in Bachelor of Management Information Systems. I only hope to accelerate in this new career choice, 
              noting there will be bumps along the way. I hope I never burn out as I did in veterinary medicine. 
              Owning horses has always been a massive passion of mine, but they are costly, and it is essential 
              for me that my job can help support my passion and, more importantly, my family. So please sit back, 
              scroll down, and meet the horses helping me live my passion and my family supporting me along the way.
