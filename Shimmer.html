                My dear Shimmer. Shimmer was my first Foundation Bred Appaloosa and will always be missed. 
                I lost Shimmer in 2021 after a long year of battling some unknown neurological issue. 
                She was in every aspect my dream mare, and I was hoping she still be here with me to help 
                my Appaloosa journey grow. However, I got to own her for four incredible years and cherish 
                every moment. Artemis has some very big shoes to fill, but she fills them well. I wouldn’t expect 
                anything less, as she is the granddaughter of Shimmer.  Shimmer subtly shows off her Appaloosa characteristics,
                but they are there! A fun fact, on her dam (mother’s side), a <a href="https://www.secretariat.com/">Secretariat</a> is her 4th grandsire.
