                Say hello to Artemis! She is a yearling filly; she will be two years old in June and is a Foundation Bred Appaloosa. 
                She is called a non-characteristic Appaloosa and displays no Appaloosa characteristics due to the play of Appaloosa 
                genetics and not receiving the LP gene. The LP gene flips on the spots the Appaloosa is known for (though not every 
                Appaloosa has spots). A great site to learn more about Appaloosa genes is <a href="https://www.appaloosaproject.co/">The Appaloosa Project</a>. 
                Artemis has grown so much since this professional picture was taken, and she is near and dear to my heart as she 
                is the “granddaughter” of my beloved Shimmer.
